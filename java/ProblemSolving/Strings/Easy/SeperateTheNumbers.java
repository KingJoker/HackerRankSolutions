/*
A numeric string, s, is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of two or more
positive integers, a[1],a[2],...,a[n], satisfying the following conditions:
1. a[i]-a[i-1]=1 for any 1<i<=n (i.e., each element in the sequence is 1 more than the previous element).
2. No a[i] contains a leading zero. For example, we can split s=10203 into the sequence {1,02,03},
but it is not beautiful because 02 and 03 have leading zeroes.
3. The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged.
For example, we can split s=312 into the sequence {3,1,2}, but it is not beautiful because it
breaks our first constraint (i.e., 1-3!=1).
The diagram below depicts some beautiful strings:
"1234" = "1"+"2"+"3"+"4"
"91011" = "9" + "10" + "11"
"99100" = "99" + "100"
You must perform q queries where each query consists of some integer string s.
For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line.
If it's beautiful, print YES x, where x is the first number of the increasing sequence.
If there are multiple such values of x, choose the smallest. Otherwise, print NO.
*Function Description
Complete the separateNumbers function in the editor below. It should print a string as described above.
*separateNumbers has the following parameter:
s: an integer value represented as a string
*Input Format
The first line contains an integer q, the number of strings to evaluate.
Each of the next q lines contains an integer string s to query.
*Constraints
1<=q<=10
1<= |s| <=32
s[i]âˆˆ[0-9]
*Output Format
For each query, print its answer on a new line (i.e., either YES x where x is the
smallest first number of the increasing sequence, or NO).
*Sample Input 0
7
1234
91011
99100
101103
010203
13
1
*Sample Output 0
YES 1
YES 9
YES 99
NO
NO
NO
NO
*Explanation 0
The first three numbers are beautiful (see the diagram above). The remaining numbers are not beautiful:
For s=101103, all possible splits violate the first and/or second conditions.
For s=010203, it starts with a zero so all possible splits violate the second condition.
For s=13, the only possible split is {1,3}, which violates the first condition.
For s=1, there are no possible splits because s only has one digit.
*Sample Input 1
4
99910001001
7891011
9899100
999100010001
*Sample Output 1
YES 999
YES 7
YES 98
NO
