/*
A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type.
There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched.
For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced.
The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met:
It contains no unmatched brackets.
The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO.
*Function Description
Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below.
It must return a string: YES if the sequence is balanced or NO if it is not.
*isBalanced has the following parameter(s):
s: a string of brackets
*Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of strings.
Each of the next n lines contains a single string s, a sequence of brackets.
*Constraints
1<=n<=10^3
1<= |s| <=10^3, where |s| is the length of the sequence.
All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
*Output Format
For each string, return YES or NO.
*Sample Input
3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
*Sample Output
YES
NO
YES
*Explanation
The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are not balanced: [(]).
The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
